Project 2 - 600.120

So I hate making excuses, but this project was a huge stuggle to get done because of issues I was having with my computer.
So my old computer gave out, forcing me to get a new one a few weeks ago. But the "new" computer I bought started
having hardware issues almost immediately forcing me to return it. This happened around the time that project 2 was
announced and released. So, I tried my best with my schedule and using friends' laptops to get the project done. In
hindsight, I definitely could have done much more to get this done and much more functional before it was due, but 
unfortunately this is all I have to show for what I got done. I'm fully aware that the code is most likely less than
functional and that my test file is lackluster to say the least, but I had to at least submit something I knew would
compile so I wouldn't a zero. I feel terrible for not getting this done more promptly, but circumstances and my own
mistake of not budgeting time better lead to this, frankly, poor quality project being submitted. I assure you, this
isn't my usual standard for work, but I am also scrambling to get everything done for all of my classes with the small
amount of time on a computer that I have.
